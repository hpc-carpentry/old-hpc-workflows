Snakemake is one of many tools to automate file-based data processing
pipelines. It is a tool to create reproducible and scalable data analyses.
Snakemake workflows are described via a human readable, Python based
language.

If you have used `make` before, then you will be familiar with much of how
Snakemake works.

The rest of these lessons aim to teach you how to use Snakemake by example.
Our goal is to automate the example workflow discussed in the previous
episode, and have it do everything for us in parallel regardless of where and
how it is run (and have it be reproducible!).

Create a file, called `Snakefile`, with the following content:

~~~
# Count words in one of the books
rule count_words:
    input: 'books/isles.txt'
    output: 'isles.dat'
    shell: 'python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat'
~~~
{: .language-python}

This is a [build file][ref-build-file], which for Snakemake is called a
Snakefile - a file executed by Snakemake. Note that aside from a few keyword
additions like `rule`, it follows standard Python 3 syntax.

Let us go through each line in turn:

* `#` denotes a *comment*. Any text from `#` to the end of the line is
ignored by Snakemake.
* `isles.dat` is a [target][ref-target], a file to be
created, or built. In Snakemake, these are also called **outputs**.
* `books/isles.txt` is a [dependency][ref-dependency], a
file that is needed to build or update the target. Targets can have zero or
more dependencies. Dependencies in Snakemake are called **inputs**.
* `python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat` is an
[action][ref-action], a command that will build or update the target using
the dependencies. In this case the action is a set of shell commands (in
later episodes we see how to use Python code).
* Like python, you can use either tabs or spaces for indentation (don't use both!).
* Together, the target, dependencies, and actions form a
[rule][ref-rule]. A rule is a recipe for how to make things.

The rule we just created describes how to build the output `isles.dat` using
the action `python wordcount.py` and the input `books/isles.txt`.

Information that was implicit in our shell script - that we are generating a
file called `isles.dat` and that creating this file requires
`books/isles.txt` - is now made explicit by Snakemake's syntax.

Let's first ensure we start from scratch and delete the `.dat`, `.png`, and
`results.txt` files we created earlier:

~~~
rm *.dat *.png results.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

By default, Snakemake looks for a file called `Snakefile`, and we can run
Snakemake as follows:

~~~
snakemake --cores 1
~~~
{: .language-bash}

It is possible to use more cores, but a single core is sufficient for now.
By default, Snakemake tells us what it's doing as it executes actions:

~~~
Provided cores: 1
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
        count   jobs
        1       count_words
        1

rule count_words:
    input: books/isles.txt
    output: isles.dat
    jobid: 0

Finished job 0.
1 of 1 steps (100%) done
~~~
{: .output}

If there are errors, check your syntax. Remember, aside from new keywords
like `rule` and `input`, Snakemake follows Python syntax. Let's see if we got
what we expected:

~~~
head -5 isles.dat
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The first 5 lines of `isles.dat` should look exactly like before.

> ## Snakefiles Do Not Have to be Called `Snakefile`
>
> We don't have to call our Snakefile `Snakefile`. However, if we call it
> something else we need to tell Snakemake where to find it. This we can do
> using the `-s` flag. For example, if our Snakefile is named `MyOtherSnakefile`:
>
> ~~~
> snakemake --cores 1 -s MyOtherSnakefile
> ~~~
>{: .language-bash}
>
{: .callout}

When we re-run our Snakefile, Snakemake now informs us that:

~~~
Nothing to be done.
~~~
{: .output}

This is because our target, `isles.dat`, has now been created, and Snakemake
will not create it again. To see how this works, let's pretend to update one
of the text files. Rather than opening the file in an editor, we can use the
shell `touch` command to update its timestamp (which would happen if we did
edit the file):

~~~
touch books/isles.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

If we compare the timestamps of `books/isles.txt` and `isles.dat`,

~~~
ls -l books/isles.txt isles.dat
~~~
{: .language-bash}

then we see that `isles.dat`, the target, is now older than`books/isles.txt`,
its dependency:

~~~
-rw-r--r--    1 mjj      Administ   323972 Jun 12 10:35 books/isles.txt
-rw-r--r--    1 mjj      Administ   182273 Jun 12 09:58 isles.dat
~~~
{: .output}

If we run Snakemake again,

~~~
snakemake --cores 1
~~~
{: .language-bash}

then it recreates `isles.dat`:

~~~
Provided cores: 1
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
        count   jobs
        1       count_words
        1

rule count_words:
    input: books/isles.txt
    output: isles.dat
    jobid: 0

Finished job 0.
1 of 1 steps (100%) done
~~~
{: .output}

When it is asked to build a target, Snakemake checks the 'last modification
time' of both the target and its dependencies. If any dependency has been
updated since the target, then the actions are re-run to update the target.
Using this approach, Snakemake knows to only rebuild the files that, either
directly or indirectly, depend on the file that changed. This is called an
[incremental build][ref-incremental]. Later on we will see how to
recalculate outputs when the code also changes.

> ## Incremental Builds Improve Efficiency

> By only rebuilding files when required, Snakemake makes your processing
> more efficient.
{: .callout}

> ## Snakefiles as Documentation
>
> By explicitly recording the inputs to and outputs from steps in our
> analysis and the dependencies between files, Snakefiles act as a type
> of documentation, reducing the number of things we have to remember.
{: .callout}

Let's add another rule to the end of `Snakefile`. Note that rules cannot have
the same name, so we'll call this one `count_words_abyss`.

~~~
rule count_words_abyss:
	input: 	'books/abyss.txt'
	output: 'abyss.dat'
	shell: 	'python wordcount.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat'
~~~
{: .language-python}

If we run Snakemake,

~~~
snakemake --cores 1
~~~
{: .language-bash}

then we get:

~~~
Nothing to be done.
~~~
{: .output}

Nothing happens because Snakemake attempts to build the first target it finds in
the Snakefile, the [default target][ref-default-target], which is `isles.dat`
and this rule is already up-to-date. We need to explicitly tell Snakemake we
want to build `abyss.dat`:

~~~
snakemake --cores 1 abyss.dat
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Now, we get:

~~~
Provided cores: 1
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
        count   jobs
        1       count_words_abyss
        1

rule count_words_abyss:
    input: books/abyss.txt
    output: abyss.dat
    jobid: 0

Finished job 0.
1 of 1 steps (100%) done
~~~
{: .output}

{: .callout}

We may want to remove all our data files so we can explicitly recreate them all.
We can introduce a new target, and associated rule, to do this. We will call it
`clean`, as this is a common name for rules that delete auto-generated files,
like our `.dat` files. Add the following rule to the start of your Snakefile.

~~~
# delete everything so we can re-run things
rule clean:
    shell: 'rm -f *.dat'
~~~
{: .language-python}

This is an example of a rule that has no inputs or outputs! We just want to
remove the data files whether or not they exist. If we run Snakemake and specify
this target:

~~~
snakemake --cores 1 clean
~~~
{: .language-bash}

then we get:

~~~
Provided cores: 1
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
        count   jobs
        1       clean
        1

rule clean:
    jobid: 0

Finished job 0.
1 of 1 steps (100%) done
~~~
{: .output}

An `ls` of our current directory reveals that all of our troublesome output
files are now gone (as planned)!

We can add a similar command to create all the data files. We can put this at
the top of our Snakefile so that it is the [default
target][ref-default-target], which is executed by default if no target is
given to the `snakemake` command:

~~~
rule dats:
     input:
         'isles.dat',
         'abyss.dat'
~~~
{: .language-python}

This is an example of a rule with dependencies that are targets of other
rules. When Snakemake runs, it will check to see if the dependencies exist
and, if not, will see if rules are available that will create these. If such
rules exist it will invoke these first, otherwise Snakemake will raise an
error.

> ## Dependencies
>
> The order of rebuilding dependencies is arbitrary. You should not
> assume that they will be built in the order in which they are
> listed.
>
> Dependencies must form a [directed acyclic graph][ref-dag]. A target cannot
> depend on a dependency which itself, or one of its dependencies,
> depends on that target.
{: .callout}

This rule is also an example of a rule that has no actions. It is used purely
to trigger the build of its dependencies, if needed.

If we run,

~~~
snakemake --cores 1 dats
~~~
{: .language-bash}

then snakemake creates the data files:

~~~
Provided cores: 1
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
        count   jobs
        1       count_words
        1       count_words_abyss
        1       dats
        3

rule count_words_abyss:
    input: books/abyss.txt
    output: abyss.dat
    jobid: 1

Finished job 1.
1 of 3 steps (33%) done

rule count_words:
    input: books/isles.txt
    output: isles.dat
    jobid: 2

Finished job 2.
2 of 3 steps (67%) done

localrule dats:
    input: isles.dat, abyss.dat
    jobid: 0

Finished job 0.
3 of 3 steps (100%) done
~~~
{: .output}

If we run `dats` again, then snakemake will see that the dependencies
(isles.dat and abyss.dat) are already up to date. Given the target `dats` has
no actions, there is `nothing to be done`:

~~~
snakemake --cores 1 dats
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Nothing to be done
~~~
{: .output}

Our Snakefile now looks like this:

~~~
rule dats:
     input:
         'isles.dat',
         'abyss.dat'

# delete everything so we can re-run things
rule clean:
    shell:  'rm -f *.dat'

# Count words in one of the books
rule count_words:
    input: 	'books/isles.txt'
    output: 'isles.dat'
    shell: 	'python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat'

rule count_words_abyss:
    input: 	'books/abyss.txt'
    output: 'abyss.dat'
    shell: 	'python wordcount.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat'
~~~
{: .language-python}

The following figure shows a graph of the dependencies embodied within our
Snakefile, involved in building the `dats` target:

At this point, it becomes important to see what snakemake is doing behind the
scenes. What commands is snakemake actually running? Snakemake has a special
option (`-p`), that prints every command it is about to run. Additionally, we
can also perform a dry run with `-n`. A dry run does nothing, and simply
prints out commands instead of actually executing them. Very useful for
debugging!

~~~
snakemake --cores 1 clean
snakemake --cores 1 -n -p isles.dat
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Building DAG of jobs...
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	count_words
	1

rule count_words:
    input: books/isles.txt
    output: isles.dat
    jobid: 0

python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	count_words
	1
This was a dry-run (flag -n). The order of jobs does not reflect the order of execution.
