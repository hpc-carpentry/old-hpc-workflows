title: "Wildcards"
teaching: 30
exercises: 20
questions:
- "How can I abbreviate the rules in my pipeline?"
objectives:
- "Use Snakemake wildcards to simplify our rules."
- "Understand that outputs depend not only on the input data files but
also on the scripts or code."
keypoints:
- "Use `{output}` to refer to the output of the current rule."
- "Use `{input}` to refer to the dependencies of the current rule."
- "You can use Python indexing to retrieve individual outputs and inputs
(example: `{input[0]}`)"
- "Wildcards can be named (example: `{input.file1}`)."
- "Naming the code or scripts used by a rule as inputs ensures that the rule
is executed if the code or script changes."

After the exercise at the end of the previous episode, our Snakefile looked like
this:

~~~
# Generate summary table
rule zipf_test:
    input:
        'isles.dat',
        'abyss.dat',
        'last.dat'
    output: 'results.txt'
    shell: 'python zipf_test.py abyss.dat isles.dat last.dat > results.txt'

rule dats:
    input:
        'isles.dat',
        'abyss.dat',
        'last.dat'

# delete everything so we can re-run things
rule clean:
    shell: 'rm -f *.dat results.txt'

# Count words in one of the books
rule count_words:
    input: 'books/isles.txt'
    output: 'isles.dat'
    shell: 'python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat'

rule count_words_abyss:
    input: 'books/abyss.txt'
    output: 'abyss.dat'
    shell: 'python wordcount.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat'

rule count_words_last:
    input: 'books/last.txt'
    output: 'last.dat'
    shell: 'python wordcount.py books/last.txt last.dat'
~~~
{: .language-python}

This has a lot of duplication. For example, the names of text files and data
files are repeated in many places throughout the Snakefile. Snakefiles are
a form of code and, in any code, repetition can lead to problems (e.g. we rename
a data file in one part of the Snakefile but forget to rename it elsewhere).

{: .callout}

Let us set about removing some of the repetition from our Snakefile.  In our
`zipf_test` rule we duplicate the data file names and the name of the results
file name:

~~~
rule zipf_test:
    input:  'abyss.dat', 'last.dat', 'isles.dat'
    output: 'results.txt'
    shell: 'python zipf_test.py abyss.dat isles.dat last.dat > results.txt'
~~~
{: .language-python}

Looking at the results file name first, we can replace it in the action with
`{output}`:

~~~
rule zipf_test:
    input:  'abyss.dat', 'last.dat', 'isles.dat'
    output: 'results.txt'
    shell:  'python zipf_test.py abyss.dat isles.dat last.dat > {output}'
~~~
{: .language-python}

`{output}` is a Snakemake [wildcard][ref-wildcard] which is equivalent to the
value we specified for the rule output.

We can replace the dependencies in the action with `{input}`:

~~~
rule zipf_test:
    input:  'abyss.dat', 'last.dat', 'isles.dat'
    output: 'results.txt'
    shell:  'python zipf_test.py {input} > {output}'
~~~
{: .language-python}

`{input}` is another wildcard which means 'all the inputs of the current rule'.
Again, when Snakemake runs it will replace this variable with the actual inputs.

Let's update our text files and re-run our rule:

~~~
touch books/*.txt
snakemake -c 1 results.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

We get:

As we saw, `{input}` means 'all the dependencies of the current rule'. This
works well for `zipf_test` as its action treats all the dependencies the same
- as the input for the `zipf_test.py` script.

Time for you to update all the rules that build a `.dat` file to use the
`{input}` and `{output}` wildcards.

## Handling dependencies differently

For many rules, we will need to make finer distinctions between inputs. It is
not always appropriate to pass all inputs as a lump to your action. For example,
our rules for `.dat` use their first (and only) dependency specifically as the
input file to `wordcount.py`. If we add additional dependencies (as we will soon
do) then we don't want these being passed as input files to `wordcount.py`: it
expects just one input file.

Let's see this in action. We need to add `wordcount.py` as a dependency of each
of our data files so that the rules will be executed if the script changes. In
this case, we can use `{input[0]}` to refer to the first dependency, and
`{input[1]}` to refer to the second:

~~~
rule count_words:
    input: 'wordcount.py', 'books/isles.txt'
    output: 'isles.dat'
    shell: 'python {input[0]} {input[1]} {output}'
~~~
{: .language-python}

Alternatively, we can name our dependencies:

~~~
rule count_words_abyss:
    input:
        cmd='wordcount.py',
        book='books/abyss.txt'
    output: 'abyss.dat'
    shell: 'python {input.cmd} {input.book} {output}'
~~~
{: .language-python}

Let's mark `wordcount.py` as updated, and re-run the pipeline:

~~~
touch wordcount.py
snakemake -c 1
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~

rule count_words_abyss:

    output: abyss.dat
    jobid: 2

Finished job 2.
1 of 3 steps (33%) done

rule count_words:
    input: wordcount.py, books/isles.txt
    output: isles.dat
    jobid: 1

Finished job 1.
2 of 3 steps (67%) done

rule zipf_test:
    input: abyss.dat, last.dat, isles.dat
    output: results.txt
    jobid: 0

Finished job 0.
3 of 3 steps (100%) done
~~~
{: .output}

Notice how `last.dat` (which does not depend on `wordcount.py`) is not
rebuilt.

Intuitively, we should also add `wordcount.py` as dependency for
`results.txt`, as the final table should be rebuilt if we remake the `.dat`
files. However, it turns out we don't have to! Let's see what happens to
`results.txt` when we update `wordcount.py`:

~~~
touch wordcount.py
snakemake -c 1 results.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

then we get:

~~~

    output: abyss.dat
    jobid: 2

rule count_words:
    input: wordcount.py, books/isles.txt
    output: isles.dat
    jobid: 1

rule zipf_test:

    output: results.txt
    jobid: 0

{: .output}

The whole pipeline is triggered, even the creation of the `results.txt` file!
To understand this, note that according to the dependency graph, `results.txt`
depends on the `.dat` files. The update of `wordcount.py` triggers an update of
the `*.dat` files. Thus, `Snakemake` sees that the dependencies (the `.dat`
files) are newer than the target file (`results.txt`) and it therefore recreates
`results.txt`. This is an example of the power of `Snakemake`: updating a subset
of the files in the pipeline triggers rerunning the appropriate downstream
steps.
