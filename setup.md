title: Setup
---

There are several pieces of software you need to install before the workshop.
Though installation help will be provided at the workshop, we recommend that
these tools are installed (or at least downloaded) beforehand. Anaconda
Python is a very large download.

## Lesson Data Files

The files used in this lesson can be downloaded:

* [Linux/Mac](files/workflow-engines-lesson.tar.gz)
* [Windows](files/workflow-engines-lesson.zip)

Once downloaded, please extract to the directory you wish to work in for all the
hands-on exercises. If you are working on the Linux or Mac command-line, you can
do something like the following. We assume you have downloaded the file to
`~/Downloads`:

~~~
cd
mkdir workflow-workshop
cd workflow-workshop
mv ../Downloads/workflow-engines-lesson.tar.gz .
tar xf workflow-engines-lesson.tar.gz
~~~
{:.language-bash}

On Windows, please use the Windows Explorer to create a directory and extract
the Zip file into it.

Solutions for most episodes can be found in the `.solutions` directory inside
the code download.

A `requirements.txt` file is included in the download. As described below,
this can be used to install the required Python packages.

## Python 3 / Anaconda

You will need Python 3.6 or better to use the sample files, since some
relatively new Python features are used. Instructions are given here for
installing Anaconda, although any Python will work.

1. Visit the [Anaconda download page][anaconda]
2. Select your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Download the Python 3 64-bit graphical installer.
4. After the download completes, run the installer to install Anaconda.

> ## Follow the Installation Guide

> If you need more detailed guidance, then please follow the [Anaconda
> Installation guide][anaconda-installation].

### Updating Anaconda

1. Once Anaconda is installed, it is a good idea to update it.
2. The article [Keeping Anaconda Up To Date][anaconda-update] is a good guide to
   updating Anaconda after it is installed.
3. It boils down to opening an Anaconda terminal and running the command:

~~~
conda update --all
~~~
{: .source}

> ## Updating is not essential for this course
>
> If you would rather skip updating, then it is not essential for this course.
{: .callout}

### Additional Libraries

The example code also requires the `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries. They
are installed by default with Anaconda, but if you are using a different
Python you may need to install them manually. Using `pip`, the command would
be:

~~~
pip install --user numpy matplotlib
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The example files download also contains a `requirements.txt` file that can
be used to specify the required packages for a Python virtual environment.
There are many guides to this process online, including the [official
documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

## Snakemake

Once you have Python 3 available, you need to install the Snakemake library.

### Anaconda

You can install Snakemake at an Anaconda prompt:

~~~
conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge snakemake-minimal
~~~
{: .language-bash}

> ## Note
> At the time of writing, the `snakemake` conda package was not installing correctly,
> however the `snakemake-minimal` was working. This lesson does not require any
> features beyond those included with the minimal install.
{: .callout}

### Vanilla Python

You can install Snakemake with:

~~~
pip install --user snakemake
~~~
{: .language-bash}

If you used the supplied `requirements.txt` to create a Python virtual
environment then `snakemake` should already be installed. For more information,
please refer to the [Snakemake installation
documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).

## Windows-Specific Instructions

Some of the commands used in this lesson assume that some common Linux commands
are available. These include `rm`, and `tar`. These commands are not available
by default on Windows systems. While there are many solutions, including using
the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), a simple approach that we have tested is
to install Git for Windows. This installs a lightweight command-line environment
that contains the required Linux commands and can be configured to use Anaconda
Python.

First, download and install the Windows [Git client][git-win].

Next, make sure you have installed Anaconda as described above.

The final, and critical, step is tell Git Bash where Anaconda is installed, so
that you can use Anaconda Python from Git Bash. First, open an Anaconda terminal
and identify the installation location of Anaconda with this command (if the
`which` command is not available, please ensure you have installed Git Bash with
all default options):

~~~
which anaconda
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Take note of the result. It will typically be something like
`/c/Users/YourUserName/Anaconda3/Scripts/conda` for user installs, and
`/c/Users/YourUserName/AppData/Local/Continuum/Anaconda3/Scripts/conda` for
system-wide installs.

Now you can add Anaconda to your Git Bash `$PATH`:

1. Open Git Bash from the Start Menu.
2. Using the location of Anaconda you identified in the previous step, run the
   following command: `export
   PATH=$PATH:~/AppData/Local/Continuum/Anaconda3/Scripts`
    1. You can replace `/c/Users/YourUserName` with `~`
    2. You **should not** include the trailing `/conda`
3. Run the following command: `source activate`

Now you are good to go!

> ## Making it Permanent
>
> You will need to repeat the previous three steps everytime you open
> a new Git Bash shell. If you want to make these changes permanent then you
> can use the following commands in Git Bash to add the changes to `$PATH`
> to your `.bashrc` file (remember to substitute the actual location of your
> Anaconda installation):
>
> ~~~
> cd
> echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/AppData/Local/Continuum/Anaconda3/Scripts' >> .bashrc`
> echo 'source activate >> .bashrc'
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> **Note that you must use single quotes, not double quotes due to the way that
> `echo` expands values.**
